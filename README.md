# Student Directory #

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at Villains Academy.

I completed this task during the 4th week of the Makers Precourse. The commits break down each aspect of making a program from start to finish; whether that be refractoring, involving methods, and sending information to external files (STDIN / STDOUT). 

*Explained*
- The user is able to input the names of students at the school.
- The user can then save these students in a csv file. 
- This information can be reloaded when the application is revisited.
- Cohort is set to 'November' for every student. 

## How to use ##

```shell
ruby directory.rb
```
